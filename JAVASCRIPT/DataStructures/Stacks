Stacks are a data structure that store information in the form of a list. They allow only adding and removing elements under a LIFO pattern (last in, first out). In stacks, elements can't be added or removed out of order, they always have to follow the LIFO pattern.

To understand how this works, imagine a stack of papers on top of your desk. You can only add more papers to the stack by placing them on top of all the others. And you can remove a paper from the stack only by taking the one that is on top of all the others. Last in, first out. LIFO. 😉

Stacks are useful when we need to make sure elements follow the LIFO pattern. Some examples of stack usage are:

JavaScript's call stack.
Managing function invocations in various programming languages.
The undo/redo functionality many programs offer.
There's more than one way to implement a stack, but probably the simplest is using an array with its push and pop methods. If we only use pop and push for adding and deleting elements, we'll always follow the LIFO pattern and so operate over it like a stack.

Another way is to implement it like a list, which may look like this:

// We create a class for each node within the stack
class Node {
    // Each node has two properties, its value and a pointer that indicates the node that follows
    constructor(value){
        this.value = value
        this.next = null
    }
}

// We create a class for the stack
class Stack {
    // The stack has three properties, the first node, the last node and the stack size
    constructor(){
        this.first = null
        this.last = null
        this.size = 0
    }
    // The push method receives a value and adds it to the "top" of the stack
    push(val){
        var newNode = new Node(val)
        if(!this.first){
            this.first = newNode
            this.last = newNode
        } else {
            var temp = this.first
            this.first = newNode
            this.first.next = temp
        }
        return ++this.size
    }
    // The pop method eliminates the element at the "top" of the stack and returns its value
    pop(){
        if(!this.first) return null
        var temp = this.first
        if(this.first === this.last){
            this.last = null
        }
        this.first = this.first.next
        this.size--
        return temp.value
    }
}

const stck = new Stack

stck.push("value1")
stck.push("value2")
stck.push("value3")

console.log(stck.first) /* 
        Node {
        value: 'value3',
        next: Node { value: 'value2', next: Node { value: 'value1', next: null } }
        }
    */
console.log(stck.last) // Node { value: 'value1', next: null }
console.log(stck.size) // 3

stck.push("value4")
console.log(stck.pop())
